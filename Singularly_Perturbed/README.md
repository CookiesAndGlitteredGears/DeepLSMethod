# Singularly Perturbed Equation

Jupyter Notebooks in this folder are for the numerical example in section 4.2.

1. Different activation functions: either Leaky ReLU or Sigmoid
2. Parameter h is the size of quadrature points in the domian. In this example the domain is [-1,1], hence 2/h is the number of quadrature points.
